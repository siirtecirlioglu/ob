# Orderbook - XBT/USD

This is a very simple orderbook showing asks and bids for XBT/USD.

## How to run the code
The codebase includes the pre-built code. You can simply run the below command from the root of the project (i.e. where package.json file is):
```bash
npm run start:prod
```

The recommended browser for testing is Chrome as the styling has only been tested there.

#### Alternative
If the above doesn't work, then you can run the below commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run start:local
```
